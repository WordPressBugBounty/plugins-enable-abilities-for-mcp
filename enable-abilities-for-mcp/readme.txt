Manage which WordPress Abilities are exposed to MCP servers. Supports WooCommerce, The Events Calendar, and any custom post type.

== Description ==

**Enable Abilities for MCP** gives you full control over which WordPress Abilities are available to AI assistants through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Adapter.

WordPress 6.9 introduced the Abilities API, allowing external tools to discover and execute actions on your site. This plugin extends that functionality by registering a comprehensive set of content management abilities and providing a simple admin interface to toggle each one on or off.

= Features =

* **58 abilities** organized in 13 categories: Core, Read, Write, SEO (Rank Math), SEO (SEOPress), SEO (Yoast), Utility, Multilanguage, Custom Post Types, WooCommerce, The Events Calendar, Code Snippets, and JetEngine Options Pages
* **WooCommerce integration** — dedicated abilities to manage products, orders, and customers using the native WooCommerce API (HPOS-compatible, formally declared)
* **The Events Calendar integration** — list, get, create, and update events with venue, organizer, and date filters
* **Admin dashboard** with toggle switches for each ability
* **Per-ability control** — expose only what you need
* **Secure by design** — proper capability checks, input sanitization, and per-post permission validation
* **WPCS compliant** — fully passes WordPress Coding Standards (phpcs)
* **MCP-ready** — all abilities include `show_in_rest` and `mcp.public` metadata

= Available Abilities =

**Read (safe, query-only):**

* Get posts with filters (status, category, tag, search)

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New** and search for **Enable Abilities for MCP**.
2. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
3. Go to **Settings > WP Abilities** to manage which abilities are active.
4. Install and configure the [MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/releases) plugin to connect with AI assistants.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need anything else for this plugin to work? =

Yes. This plugin requires WordPress 6.9+ (which includes the Abilities API) and the MCP Adapter plugin to connect abilities with AI assistants like Claude.

= Are all abilities enabled by default? =

Yes. On first activation, all abilities are enabled. You can disable any of them from **Settings > WP Abilities**.

= Is it safe to enable write abilities? =

Write abilities respect WordPress capabilities. For example, creating a post requires the `publish_posts` capability, and editing checks per-post permissions. The MCP user must have the appropriate WordPress role.

= Does it work on Multisite? =

Yes. The plugin can be network-activated. Each site in the network has its own ability configuration.

= Does it work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. The Custom Post Types section automatically detects WooCommerce products, orders, coupons, and any other registered post type. You can list, create, update, and delete items with full access to WooCommerce meta fields like `_price`, `_sku`, `_stock_status`, `_regular_price`, and more.

= Can I add custom abilities? =

This plugin registers abilities using the standard `wp_register_ability()` API. You can register additional abilities in your own plugin using the `wp_abilities_api_init` hook.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.16 =
* Fix: `ewpa_authenticate_api_key()` now uses a static re-entry guard (`$resolving`) to prevent infinite recursion when `user_can()` inside `ewpa_validate_api_key()` triggers `map_meta_cap`. Plugins like Yoast SEO hook `map_meta_cap` and call `wp_get_current_user()` from within it, re-entering the `determine_current_user` filter and causing unbounded recursion (PHP fatal / HTTP 500). Reproduced with Yoast SEO + WPML String Translation active.

= 2.0.15 =
* Enhancement: `ewpa/je-update-options-page-field` now supports repeater fields — pass an array of row objects where each key matches a sub-field name. `ewpa/je-get-options-page` now returns `repeater_fields` (name, title, type) for repeater fields so the AI can inspect the expected row structure before writing.

= 2.0.14 =
* New: JetEngine Options Pages section (3 abilities) — `ewpa/je-list-options-pages` lists all registered options pages with their field schema; `ewpa/je-get-options-page` returns field values for a given slug; `ewpa/je-update-options-page-field` writes a single field value with blocklist protection (html, tab, accordion, endpoint types are blocked). Both list and get abilities are enabled by default; update is off by default. Requires JetEngine with the Options Pages module enabled.
* Fix: `ewpa_register_ability_with_log()` wrapper closure now uses `$input = null` (optional parameter) so abilities without an `input_schema` are not broken by PHP 8.4's `ArgumentCountError` when `WP_Ability::invoke_callback()` calls them with zero arguments.
* Updated: Total abilities: 58 in 13 categories

= 2.0.13 =
* Fix: `ewpa/update-post`, `ewpa/create-post`, `ewpa/create-page`, `ewpa/create-cpt-item`, `ewpa/update-cpt-item`, `ewpa/search-replace`, and `ewpa/tec-update-event` now use `wp_slash()` instead of `wp_kses_post()` on post content before passing to `wp_insert_post()` / `wp_update_post()`. This prevents double-unslashing that corrupted JSON Unicode escapes (e.g. `<` → `u003c`) in Gutenberg block attributes such as Yoast FAQ questions. KSES is now applied by WordPress via the `content_save_pre` filter, which correctly respects `unfiltered_html` capability — allowing admins to save `<script type="application/ld+json">` inside `wp:html` blocks without stripping.

= 2.0.12 =
* New: `ewpa/create-code-snippet` ability — creates a PHP snippet via the Code Snippets plugin (2.x or 3.x). Snippet is always saved as inactive; activation requires a manual step from wp-admin. Validates PHP syntax via `token_get_all( TOKEN_PARSE )`, blocks dangerous functions (`eval`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `passthru`, `popen`, `proc_open`, `base64_decode`, `file_put_contents`, `unlink`, `chmod`), and fires `ewpa_after_create_code_snippet` for audit. Requires `manage_options`.
* Updated: Total abilities: 55 in 12 categories

= 2.0.11 =
* New: `ewpa/create-code-snippet` ability — creates a PHP snippet via the Code Snippets plugin (2.x or 3.x). Snippet is always saved as inactive; activation requires a manual step from wp-admin. Validates PHP syntax via `token_get_all( TOKEN_PARSE )`, blocks dangerous functions (`eval`, `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `passthru`, `popen`, `proc_open`, `base64_decode`, `file_put_contents`, `unlink`, `chmod`), and fires `ewpa_after_create_code_snippet` for audit. Requires `manage_options`.
* Fix: `ewpa/update-post-meta` no longer applies `sanitize_text_field()` to `meta_value` — allows storing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content without corruption
* Fix: `ewpa/update-post-meta`, `ewpa/update-cpt-item`, and `ewpa/create-cpt-item` now call `wp_slash()` before `update_post_meta()` — preserves backslashes in values received via the REST API, which `update_post_meta()` internally strips via `wp_unslash()`

= 2.0.10 =
* Fix: `ewpa/update-rankmath-schema` — added missing `permission_callback` required by `WP_Ability`; absence caused a PHP notice on every page load and prevented the ability from registering correctly

= 2.0.9 =
* Fix: `ewpa/update-rankmath-schema` now correctly discoverable by MCP adapters — added `additionalProperties: true` to the `schema_data` input parameter so WordPress accepts the object schema during ability registration

= 2.0.8 =
* New: `ewpa/update-rankmath-schema` ability — writes a structured-data schema block (FAQPage, Article, Product, VideoObject, etc.) to a Rank Math schema meta key as a PHP-serialized array, so Rank Math renders it as JSON-LD in `<head>`; supports 20 schema types
* Fix: `ewpa/update-post-meta` now blocks `rank_math_schema_*` keys and returns a clear error directing users to `ewpa/update-rankmath-schema` instead — prevents PHP fatal errors caused by storing raw JSON strings in a field that Rank Math expects to hold PHP-serialized arrays
* Updated: Total abilities: 54 in 11 categories

= 2.0.7 =
* New: `ewpa/get-active-plugins` utility ability — returns all active plugins with name, version, and detected capabilities (SEO, multilanguage, WooCommerce, Events Calendar)
* New: Multilanguage section — `ewpa/set-post-language` assigns a language code to an existing post via Polylang or WPML
* New: Multilanguage section — `ewpa/link-post-translation` links two posts as translations of each other in the same translation group via Polylang or WPML
* New: Multilanguage section — `ewpa/get-post-translations` returns the full translation map for a post: language code, post ID, title, permalink, and status for each available translation via Polylang or WPML
* New: `language` and `translation_of` parameters added to `ewpa/create-post` — set the language and link a translation group in a single call when Polylang or WPML is active
* New: `ewpa_get_translation_plugin()` helper — detects the active multilanguage plugin (`polylang`, `wpml`, or empty string)
* Fix: input schema for abilities with no parameters omits the `properties` key — prevents PHP `Cannot use object of type stdClass as array` error in WordPress schema validation
* Updated: Total abilities: 53 in 11 categories

= 2.0.6 =
* New: `ewpa/get-post-meta` utility ability — reads any single post meta field by exact key; returns the value and a `found` flag indicating whether the key exists; companion to `ewpa/update-post-meta`
* New: `ewpa_after_update_post_meta` action hook — fires after every `ewpa/update-post-meta` write with `($post_id, $meta_key, $meta_value)`; SEO plugins can use it to flush their internal meta cache (e.g. TSF, AIOSEO)

= 2.0.5 =
* Fix: WooCommerce and The Events Calendar ability registrations now use `'label'` instead of `'name'` — resolves PHP notices from `WP_Abilities_Registry::register` on every page load
* Fix: WooCommerce and TEC abilities now use `'execute_callback'` instead of `'callback'` — abilities were registered but never executed
* Fix: `'woocommerce'` and `'tec'` categories now registered in `ewpa_register_ability_categories()` — abilities now appear correctly in the Abilities Explorer
* Credit: props @magicwand for the detailed report with root cause analysis and local fix

= 2.0.4 =
* Compatibility: Tested and confirmed compatible with WordPress 7.0
* Fix: `EWPA_VERSION` constant corrected to match plugin header version (was stuck at 2.0.2)

= 2.0.3 =
* New: SEOPress section — `ewpa/get-seopress` reads SEO title, description, focus keyword, canonical URL, robots (noindex/nofollow/noarchive/noimageindex/nosnippet), Open Graph, and Twitter Card for any post or page
* New: SEOPress section — `ewpa/update-seopress` updates any combination of those fields; only provided fields are modified
* New: Yoast SEO section — `ewpa/yoast-get-seo` reads SEO title, description, focus keyphrase, canonical URL, robots (noindex/nofollow/advanced), Open Graph, and Twitter Card
* New: Yoast SEO section — `ewpa/yoast-update-seo` updates any combination of those fields; only provided fields are modified
* New: Yoast SEO section — `ewpa/yoast-get-sitemap-index` fetches and parses the Yoast sitemap index, returning all registered sitemap URLs with last modification dates
* New: `ewpa/update-post-meta` utility ability — writes any post meta field by exact key; useful for SEO plugins or custom fields not covered by dedicated sections; protected against internal WP keys via blocklist (filterable with `ewpa_blocked_meta_keys`)
* Improved: SEO meta in `get-post`, `get-page`, `create-post`, `update-post`, `create-page`, and `update-page` now auto-detects the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast SEO, The SEO Framework, SEOPress, AIOSEO) instead of writing to both Yoast and Rank Math keys simultaneously
* Updated: Total abilities: 48 in 10 categories

= 2.0.2 =
* Fix: Re-release to ensure all users receive the corrected admin CSS and JavaScript — sites that auto-updated to 2.0.1 before the tab and JS fixes were in place will now receive the correct assets
* Fix: Ability count in plugin description corrected to 42 (get-page and update-comment were added in 1.9.2/1.9.3)

= 2.0.1 =
* Fix: Activity log DB table now created correctly — `PRIMARY KEY` SQL formatted for dbDelta
* Fix: `ewpa_log_activity()` is self-healing — auto-creates table on first failed insert, no manual intervention required
* Fix: Input parameter unified to `status` (was `post_status`) across `ewpa/get-posts`, `ewpa/get-pages`, and `ewpa/get-cpt-items` for consistency with write abilities
* Fix: Uninstall now cleans up `ewpa_bearer_enabled` and `ewpa_db_version` options (previously leaked on uninstall)
* Fix: Admin tabs now use WordPress native `nav-tab` classes — resolves broken button styling on sites where themes or plugins override default button CSS
* Fix: Admin JavaScript wrapped in `document.readyState` guard — tabs and toggle now work correctly on sites with optimization plugins (WP Rocket, LiteSpeed, etc.) that defer or combine scripts
* Code quality: WPCS auto-fixed 14 issues; short ternary operators and docblock corrections applied manually
* Code quality: `phpcs.xml` ruleset updated — WooCommerce and The Events Calendar custom capabilities declared
* Code quality: Zero errors across all core plugin files
* Note: If tabs or the Bearer toggle appear broken after updating, purge your Cloudflare or CDN cache — CDNs may serve stale JS/CSS files regardless of the plugin version parameter

= 2.0.0 =
* New: Activity log — tracks every MCP ability execution per user with timestamp; viewable and clearable from the admin
